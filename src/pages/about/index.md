This blog is nothing more than a collection of 1s and 0s. What you see is nothing more than a collection of colourful pixels. What you will find is nothing more than nonsense, but nothing short of meaningful. 
        
We are two sisters who seek to encapsulate the world we see into the four walls of a screen. Whether it be through the photography, short stories or thoughtful posts, we hope that you discover meaning in a world that's all too often nonsensical.
