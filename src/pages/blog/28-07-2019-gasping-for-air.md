Sometimes, the scariest nightmares are the ones that you never wake up from. Even when you try so desperately to gasp for air and drift back to the plush covers of your bed, nothing changes. The numbing feeling within the pit of your stomach remains and faded screams are the only sounds ringing breathlessly against your ear. 

When the solemn words of his death left the doctor’s lips, silence immediately followed. No one spoke a word. Only the mixed expressions of horror and wretched shock were painted on people’s faces. Not a soul had predicted this outcome. The treacherous thought had never once withered past my mind; yet my unwavering optimism only made everything hurt that much more. 

After a few long and dreadful moments passed, the truth of those words finally sank in painfully within my mind, and an abrupt beat of agony bloomed in my chest. My lungs were desperately clawing for air, yet nothing was flowing through. I could feel something warm on my cheeks before realizing that endless tears were pounding at their floodgates and blurring my vision. The walls were closing in ominously. The whispered chatter was piercing my ears. And all I could feel was numbness. 

My legs began to move before my mind had time to process any actions. I heard my name being called yet it only sounded like a soft echo in the midst of deafening screams pounding against my mind. My body did not stop running, only an endless blur of stairs crossed my eyes until there were no more ahead and I was pushing a door open. 

My vision was immediately encapsulated by the twilight sky. The glimmers of the tiny stars calmed the rapid beating of my heart and as the slow minutes disappeared, my shuddering heaves for air were finally able to turn into long, relaxed inhales and exhales.   

Then I remembered, and my heart felt like it had been shattered into broken glass. Wicked clarity slapped me mercilessly across the face and all the moments flashed before my eyes.

The flashes of colours sparkling the inside of the club. Shadowed figures in the dark. Then, the distinct sound of shots being fired erupted. Chaos followed. Thumps were heard all around as bodies fell to the floor one by one. His body was one of them. I screamed out at him but was silence by the screeches of pain and terror that filled the room. Sirens. Blood. His body was covered in crimson.

I could still feel the dried blood embedded into the creases of my palms and splashes of it that had dried roughly on my sweater. Then, without warning, the sickening metallic scent was bitterly pungent, making me shiver in disgust and misery. My back hit the wall and I slid down beside the open door while my arms came up around my torso, trying to keep the tremors at bay. 

Then, I closed my eyes and spoke a silent plea in desperation. 

Let this be a dream. Please. Oh god, let this be a dream. This isn’t real. I’m going to wake up soon and all of this will just be one horrible nightmare. It has to be. I’m not really here. 

As my eyes drifted open, the last sliver of hope was blown away with the silent tears trickling down my face. Nothing had changed. And right then and there I knew, I was never going to wake up from this. Because this did happen. And no amount of tears and prayers would ever bring him back. 

Then I heard footsteps. Someone was coming towards me and my body began to seize up in anxiety as I brought my knees closer to my chest. But after hearing the callings of my name from a familiar voice, my shoulders easily slumped back down against the wall. 

My friend frantically rushed out the door, eyes searching desperately until his gaze landed directly on me. I could see the relief wash over his worried expression as he made his way over and took a seat next to me. He didn’t say anything for a few moments, and I took them in, basking in the comfort of company. 

Then he spoke gently, “I know that you are most definitely not okay, but I still feel like I should ask.”

I bit my lips tightly, trying to stop them from quivering as I felt my eyes prickle with fresh tears. Then I let out a cracked whisper, “It just hurts.” 

“I know,” he whispered with a heavy sigh before shuffling closer beside me. “But that pain you feel right now, it will get better,” he said, while putting a comforting arm around my shoulders.  “One day, it will hurt less. I promise.” 

Hesitantly, I leaned into his touch before asking in a broken voice, “Ho-how can you be so certain?” 

I could feel him smiling as his head laid against mine, “There is a lot of power in staying hopeful.”

My head tilted towards the darkness above while I let out a defeated sigh, “I just don’t um… that’s just really difficult right now.” 

“Then just take it one day at a time,” he replies before continuing softly, “Healing takes time and you should allow yourself to take as long as you need. When you feel sad, cry until there are no more tears left. If anger consumes you, then scream until your energy disappears. Don’t hold it in. Just let yourself feel all of it. All the emotions. Only when you do, can you start moving forward.” 

I could hear him shuffle to meet my lost gaze before speaking again in a serious tone, “But can you promise me something?”

No words were spoken, yet my eyes stayed focused on him, so he continued, “Don’t let the pain drown you. I know it feels unbearable right now, but you have to fight back. And make every single moment of pain be filled with hope that one day it will fade away.”    

I nodded slightly, before taking a deep breath filled with flickering, renewed hope. 

“I’ll keep fighting until that day comes.”
