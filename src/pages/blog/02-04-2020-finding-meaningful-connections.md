When I was younger, I would often find myself chasing after friendships that left me feeling exhausted and burnt out. You know, the kind of relationships where you feel obligated to force out a laugh or express a smile that didn’t quite reach your eyes. It all felt too scripted. There was the pressure, both unconsciously and consciously, to laugh at the right time and respond when you feel was needed. Yet, my younger self continued to put on this performance because my fear of being alone was bigger than my craving for a real connection. A real friendship. 

Thinking back now, I can’t pinpoint exactly when I started to put on this act, but it was definitely long enough for it to become instinctual. Many friendships I would cling onto felt insincere and inconsequential, always centered around small talk and meaningless conversations. But being in a school environment, they were close and more or less convenient, and I knew that if I was “picky”, I would inevitably end up alone. However, being around **friends by proximity** was draining. I remember when we would play games of truth or dare or gossip about our classmates, I felt alone in a crowded room. I felt like I didn’t belong there. The relationships felt connected by strings and only became more strained as we filled the time with empty words and lack of emotional intimacy. 

But I don’t blame these people for my feelings. After all, objectively, I could have made the decision to find new friends or speak up when I didn’t like the direction of the conversation. But I didn’t do anything. I became like clay, molding myself to each person and tried to enjoy their company even though I didn’t truly feel like I belonged. However, I was so insistent on making them like me that I did it anyways. 

There were two main reasons for my actions. Firstly, I was scared to find new friends because it looked like the cliques have already formed. It felt invasive and awkward to be intruding on other classmates’ friend groups. Secondly, I was just lazy and didn’t want to make the active effort to change my situation. But that didn’t mean the thought wasn’t always burning at the forefront of my mind, prickling like a thorn splintered into my skin. 

But this all changed when I entered high school. I didn’t go to a home school so there was barely anyone I had previously befriended at my new high school. Many students had traveled to high school with their previous clique but the thought of being “invasive” didn’t shackle me down anymore. At first, I was hesitant to approach people but the fear of being alone started to physically hurt my body. If you find yourself spiraling into this feeling, here are the three main actions I executed to change my situation. 

# 1. Fake it Till You Make It

So, despite my social anxiety, I made the active decision to venture out and find friends that I had a real connection with. Being outside your comfort zone is difficult, there is always the lingering thought that they will look at you weirdly or reject you when you ask if you can sit with them or if you decide to formally introduce yourself. We are never taught this kind of skill at school, so its all trial and error for us and that’s the terrifying part that often prevents us from making any move at all. But for my experience, that is the very first step you must take in order to meet new people. You can’t always expect your parents or other friends to push you into the spotlight and you shouldn’t, because they are introducing you to people who connect with them. Not you. 

# 2. Contribute to the Conversation

The second lesson I learned was that you have the choice to be a puppet in a conversation. You can either be stringed along the conversation or direct it. When I was younger, whenever I didn’t like the topic or when I felt isolated from a conversation, I never made an effort to change the situation. But I realized that when you actually include yourself in the conversation, it makes a huge difference. It may sound obvious but when you are someone who spent years training their mind to please other people, it feels uncomfortable to speak for yourself. It was once second nature for me to filter my words to fit their opinions, but in the end, they will not be a true friend or a real relationship that you are trying to grow. Overall, in order to plant true friendships, you should be learning things about one another instead of trying to pass the time with trivial conversation that will waste everyone’s time. 

# 3. Friendships Are Not Set in Stone

Lastly, don’t be hypnotized into this idea that you are trapped to a certain friend group. I used to feel weird if I befriend people from other cliques, but I learned that it’s all in your head. I often don’t befriend the entire friend group but I often find really meaningful friendships from certain people in other cliques and thinking back on it, if I was held back by my own hesitation, I would not have grown so many friendships in the four years of high school. 

## **_But how do we determine if we are forming a meaningful friendship or if we are just wasting our time?_**

# A. You Shouldn't Feel Drained

Firstly, the friendship shouldn’t feel like an obligation. It shouldn’t feel like a chore. And most importantly, it shouldn’t feel forced. If I have to speak to this person every single day in order to maintain a friendly relationship, something is wrong. More specifically, these people become categorized into friends by proximity, where you are only friendly if they are in the same class but once the semester ends, you inevitably drift apart. I believe meaningful connections have always superseded distance. There have always been certain friendships that I make the active effort to reach out to and when I do, it feels like the pause button has been unpaused, nothing feels different and we jump right into where we left off. 

# B. It is Easy to be Vulnerable - Aren't Afraid to Speak Your MIND

This leads right into the next pro-tip: make an effort to grow and invest your time into a friendship. Just like trust, friendship is a two-way street. If you don’t go out of your way to spark conversation, ask deep questions or create memories, your relationship will only cripple like a plant never given enough water or sunlight. But sometimes, I have made the mistake of not remembering that friendship is indeed a two-way street. I would often find myself to be the only one reaching out, trying to open up to them and I’ve learned to move on from these people and cut off the rotten parts of the plant before it spreads.

# C. It Shouldn't Be A Competition

Lastly, the people you surround yourself with should not be toxic. This sounds obvious but toxicity comes in the smallest doses. I used to find myself surrounded by people that would constantly talk about their grades, their achievements and It shouldn’t feel like a constant competition between one another. (you don't feel insecure)
