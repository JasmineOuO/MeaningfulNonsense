As I write this, it has been officially two months since the last time I have been to my school. This whole quarantine situation has been making me feel isolated in a way that Iâ€™ve never felt before. The lack of social normalcy has been disorienting at first but when I started face-timing my friends everyday, it quickly became the new normal. My previous worries were once replete with deadlines, tests and getting a dress for prom. Letâ€™s just say, it went out the window pretty quickly. But at the time, so did my motivation to get any real work done. Howeverâ€¦I didnâ€™t let the time get swept under my feet. At least, I tried for the most part ðŸ˜Š

 The first couple of weeks felt like an extended March break. There was no work assigned and I couldnâ€™t decide on what to spend my time on. Everything was up in the air; I didnâ€™t know if we were going back to school soon or if this break was going to extended indefinitely. Basically, I was debating whether to spend my time reading ahead or if I should take advantage of the extra free time in my hands. In the end, thinking that the quarantine would only last three weeks, I easily chose the latter.
