As I write this, it has been officially two months since the last time I have been to my school. This whole quarantine situation has been making me feel isolated in a way that Iâ€™ve never felt before. The lack of social normalcy has been disorienting at first but when I started face-timing my friends everyday, it quickly became the new normal. My previous worries were once replete with deadlines, tests and getting a dress for prom. Letâ€™s just say, it went out the window pretty quickly. But at the time, so did my motivation to get any real work done. Howeverâ€¦I didnâ€™t let the time get swept under my feet. At least, I tried for the most part ðŸ˜Š

 The first couple of weeks felt like an extended March break. There was no work assigned and I couldnâ€™t decide on what to spend my time on. Everything was up in the air; I didnâ€™t know if we were going back to school soon or if this break was going to extended indefinitely. Basically, I was debating whether to spend my time reading ahead or if I should take advantage of the extra free time in my hands. In the end, thinking that the quarantine would only last three weeks, I easily chose the latter.

One of the first activities I took up was learning Spanish on Duolingo. It's a language I loved listening to whenever I watched "Money Heist" or "Grand Hotel" on Netflix (highly recommend those shows!).

Even though French is quite similar to Spanish, I always hated learning it because I was forced to read the books and have weekly tests on it. However, I still can't roll my r's properly so maybe I'll never really perfect the language. 

Another thing that I didn't think I would pick up again was playing the piano. I had played piano for around ten years and let's just say that the mandatory exams, music history, and harmony stripped away a lot of enjoyment. Previously, I would rarely go near the piano after accomplishing my level ten RCM exam. But then I watched "Crash Landing on You" on Netflix ( \*internal scream\* ). The OST for the K-Drama was just perfect and I felt compelled to learn it for the sake of nostalgia when I finally finished the series.

Now, relaxation and hobbies aside, I was also really stressed out. There were only a month left until university decisions were coming out. For people who hasn't gone through this, I'll just say that waiting can be a form of psychological torture. Truly. The anxiety was like a monkey on my shoulder that would follow me around all hours of the day. For some days, I would consume myself with hobbies just to keep my thoughts off of university. Especially with COVID, the future just felt very unstable and unpredictable. But luckily as the time came around, I made a choice that
