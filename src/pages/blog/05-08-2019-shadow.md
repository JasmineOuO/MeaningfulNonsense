_“How does it feel?”_

The voice felt awfully quiet. I remembered it being louder, yet the sound was fading slowly into a low ringing in my ear; all I could hear was the heaving of my own breath. 

My feet were taking me somewhere, taking sudden twists whenever a corner or person landed before my blurred vision. I could feel my lungs piercing with agony and I couldn’t remember which street I was on anymore. Everything looked similar, especially in the twilight thunderstorm. 

I fought the bolting fear pulsing through my body and stopped my legs, resulting in a staggered tumble towards the pavement. I couldn’t feel anything when my knees collided roughly with the concrete. It was as if my body was entirely numb. Steadily, I took in several greedy breaths as I tried to block out the concerning sounds of my heaves. But my attention quickly shifted as my body began to notice the gradual change in weather. The rain was no longer drowning out my thoughts. 

I could finally hear myself think. 

It spared a moment of relief before I was choked by a realisation that settled sharply in my stomach. I began to notice that not only has the rain stopped, but the once twilight darkness was beginning to wither into slivers of shadow. Gradually, I could see familiar night lamps burning brighter, bringing clarity to my mind in the midst of darkness. My eyes frantically soaked in the location; the battered building, the flickering neon sign situated on the front as well as the pounding echo of music buzzing from inside. 

I looked up from the ground and stared at the bright sign hanging in front of my eyes.

“Crimson Star,” I mumbled under my breath as my hands dug roughly into the cement. 

“No...,” I breathed out heavily. 

“No, no, no, no, no….” I whispered frantically as my fingers dug harder into the firm ground. I looked down at my hands, feeling a slight sting as droplets of blood splayed onto the rocks beneath. 

The music began to grow louder.

I could feel it pounding underneath my skin. Squeezing my eyes together in annoyance, I slammed hard fists against the cement and shook my head in anguish while my body began to disconnect from my mind. Whispers were turning into screams and I couldn’t grasp control of my instincts anymore. My fists were pounding repeatedly at the ground. My thoughts were racing too fast. The music felt like claws against my ears. But despite the torture, I knew that the worst was still to come. 

Then, without warning, the screeching melody came to a sudden stop; leaving only half a moment of haunting silence. 

 “I thought you loved that kind of music,” a voice spoke from behind me.

My body turned to ice and I could feel the shivers begin to rack my frame. Squeezing my eyes harder, I pleaded, “Get out.” 

The voice continued, “do you remember the name of that song? We used to dance to it all the time. You know when it’s like…just on the tip of your tongue but you just can’t seem to remember it? Or perhaps, there is always the possibility that my mind has already built a wall around that memory and it would be best to not try and disturb it.”

Then, before my mind could keep up, my body straightened up from the ground and turned towards the voice from behind. I still refused to open my eyes. But I could, nonetheless, recognize the familiar presence before me.

Taking a deep, shaking breath, I lifted my eyes slowly to face my never-ending nightmare. To face the figure of a dead man. “Grayson.”

“Hey you. Did you miss me?” He asked with a grin.

I could feel my lips tremble in sadness as my voice began to wobble, “Please. _Please_. I beg you. Please just … leave.”

He took several slow steps towards me. “Now, isn’t that just a bit rude? Seeing as it was _you_ who invited me to come here.”

He continued as he roughly poked his finger at my chest, pushing my feet back a little. “Hm? Am I wrong? Weren’t you the one who convinced me to come here? To this stupid club?”

Those words replayed in my head as a surging wave of guilt engulfed me. And in chorus, my breaths were turning into short, silent heaves while my thoughts were starting to drown in distress. The wall _I_ had spent months trying to build, to block him out, was cracking open. Which has now left me feeling naked and vulnerable all over again. 

His voice echoed hatefully in my ears, “What was it you said exactly? ‘C’mon Grayson, you don’t have to be afraid of being yourself. This place will show you that there are people out here just like you. You won’t have to worry about getting hurt for being gay here. _No one_ will hurt you here. Please. Trust. Me.’ “

He gritted those words as anger flared across his visage. Then he leaned in close to my face, eyes never leaving mine. “_You lied._” 

My vision began to gloss over as tears ran down my face. I wrapped my arms around myself to just hold onto something while taking several steps back. “I- I – I’m sor-ry,” I whispered. 

He broke out of his glare before letting out a sarcastic laugh. “Really, sorry? Is that honestly the only thing you can say? You know I thought with all that pent-up guilt of yours, you would be rambling your mouth off with some excuse or shitty explanation. But now… that’s just really f*cking sad if you ask me.”

I closed my eyes for a long moment and tried to block out his presence for a second. My thoughts wheeled backwards to the past, attempting to chase after a life line. Desperately, I wrestled to break through the dark clouds in my head and remember what was once told to me. There had to be a silver lining.

Then, it finally came. 

“Were you the one that was holding the gun?”

“No.”

“Did you put the bullets into the chamber?”

I shook my head.

“Did you tell those people to hurt him?”

“Of course not.”

“Well, there you go then. Those are the facts. The objective mindset you should be placing yourself in. Life almost never goes our way, but that doesn’t mean we are the ones that made it that way. And in this case, it doesn’t make you a murderer because of it. You were a victim. Both of you were. But, unlike him, you were lucky enough to survive this horrible situation.”

I let those words settle deeply in my mind. Then, when they began to transform into a low buzz within the crevices of my thoughts, I took a slow and steadier breath. 

Eventually, I was able to clear the lodge in my throat before staring back at him. “I don’t know what you want me to say.” I spoke with a voice wrapped in both seriousness and sincerity as I took a few steps forward. “But what happened to you was not my fault.” 

He scoffed lightly while shaking his head and saying, “Oh my…look at you…pulling the therapist card so damn quickly.” Then, he ran a frustrated hand through his hair before pointing a shaky finger at me, “This is exactly what I can’t stand about you. Y-y-your obnoxious ability to make everyone so f\*cking blind! Do you know that? Your friends, your family, your therapist, even the f\*cking police, they look at you and just see this blurred anomaly. Only I, and I alone have to bare the real sight of you.” Then, he dropped his arms to his side and let out a deep breath, “Well, go on then, keep going. What other bullshit have they been feeding you?”

He continued with his feet locked in place as he scrutinized my every move with a sneer. “Hm? C’mon, tell me. I’m dying to know,” he said while chuckling to himself, “see what I did there?”

Silenced breezed through the both of us. I saw the trap before the words left his mouth. No more. I refuse to play this game anymore.

“Nothing? Cat got your tongue or something? Alright, my turn then. You were told that you were a victim. You were told that you were innocent. You were told that you didn’t have me kil—”

“NO!” I screamed as I pushed him, leaving him stumbling backwards. His eyes widened slightly in shock, but I didn’t let him continue. 

Tears were still wetting my cheeks, but I didn’t let my voice quiver. My voice was booming and angry. And in some way, it was the only way I knew how to drown out the guilt and doubt swimming around my mind. 

“JUST STOP IT!” I took a shaky breath before continuing in a quieter, yet stern tone. “I know what you think of me. Y-You think of me as some sort of monster, right? Or a murderer? Whatever you may think, whatever sick thing you have labelled me as, trust me, I have thought the exact same thing before. You think I felt innocent? That I didn’t see the blood on my hands? That I didn’t think about atoning for what I have done? I was constantly hearing this voice in my head, always telling me to do horrible things to myself! I had been living in this hell, this prison and for the longest time. F*cking eternity! But I can finally tell myself that I was wrong.”

Those words tasted bitter coming out of my mouth, but I had to keep going. Even if I didn’t believe every single word, I couldn’t let him do whatever he wanted.  

I pointed back at the building behind me. “That. That day. I couldn’t have known. I couldn’t have,” tears were once again welling up in my eyes as I swallowed a lump in my throat. “I couldn’t have known,” I said while shaking my head, “How could I have known? No one knew. No one could have ever known that men with guns and hate were going to march through those doors and kill people that they couldn’t understand or accept. And I’m sorry. I truly am. But I am not to blame.”

I hated how those words settled uncomfortably in my stomach. As if they were acid burning a hole to my insides. 

He stayed silent for a moment as his stoic façade returned and his eyes fixed back on me. Ones that felt like they were penetrating right through my cracked disguise. Then he spoke up, “What does the voice tell you?”

I felt caught off guard by the question but responded. “It doesn’t matter.”

“What does it tell you?” He repeated in a calm tone.

“Like I said before, it doe—” I repeated before he interrupted, “Tell me.” 

“No.” I stood my ground but could feel my composure fracture.

“Tell. Me.” He gritted in a quiet mutter as he lowered his head and pushed both his hands in his jacket. 

I shook my head. 

I could hear him growl before he lifted his head sharply, fury evident in his expression. Violently, he ripped his hands out of his jacket and closed the small distance between us before grabbing my arms. I could feel nails digging into my skin as a scream echoed loudly in my ear. “ANSWER THE F\*\*KING QUESTION!”

He was only a few inches away from me and my eyes could only widen as I stared at the face before me. Then, my stoic expression completely shattered when I finally soaked in his face and got a good look at him. He looked exactly the same as he did that night. His hair was left in its own crazy but normal way. He smelled like dove soap and nature. His skin didn’t look pale like I remembered. It was filled with life and it should have stayed that way.

 I wanted him back. I wanted to hear him laugh again. I wanted to see that infectious smile again. I wanted to turn time back around and erase that day from ever happening. He shouldn’t have died that day and it was my fault that he had. Grayson was right. I led him to his death, and he followed me wholeheartedly because he trusted me.

And it only made my heart break further when my body felt relieved by those thoughts. They were settling more comfortably in my stomach while concurrently crushing my only silver lining to dust.

“You shouldn’t have listened to me.” I whispered as I completely broke down in his arms. “You were r-right. Gunman or not, the bottom line was that I brought you here. And that f\*cking killed y-you,” I cried as my voice stuttered with shame and fatigue, “A-a-and I think about it every single f\*cking day because you are a-always in my head, speaking to me. L-like this ghost that haunts me. And I just want no – need - you to tell me how to fix this. Tell me. Please. Tell me what I have to do for you to f-forgive me. So that you can finally stop hurting.” 

His expression looked stunned while his body stayed still for several long seconds. Then, his widened eyes flickered over my face, as if he were searching for any signs of trickery. Eventually, his grip began to loosen as his angered visage softened slightly. He let go completely and breathed out a quiet sigh before brushing past my shoulder and walking towards the building behind me. I turned around and watched as he slid down the wall of the building with one leg flat and the other bent. 

No one spoke for a long moment. 

Then I heard a small noise. I couldn’t really see his face since he was looking down, but it wasn’t long before he lifted his head and I realized that he was chuckling. 

It was an unnerving sound. One that made my chest tighten and my stomach churn uncomfortably.  

“What,” I asked tensely when his light chuckle evolved into a maniacal laugh.

His laughter eventually came to a stop as he calmed down and settled with a disturbing smile. “Sorry… but you gotta admit, I’m pretty good right? Like you’ve spent what, over seven months in therapy trying to get rid of this uhm…,” he gestured a wave in the air to find the right word before snapping, “…guilt complex bullsh*t or whatever your therapist calls it, and it only took me ten minutes to tear away your façade.” 

My fists unconsciously clenched together in frustration as a suffocating awareness settled in my mind. It made my lungs feel like the wind had been knocked out of them.

I was so stupid. I should have known that I was too vulnerable. But no. I was the idiot who had to walk right into his mouse trap.

And now, he holds my heart in his hands. 

My spirit. My hope. My future. It all lies in his f*cking hands. 

And here I am. Once again, back in my prison cell, shackled down and helpless.

“But I got to give it to you, that speech you made about the gunmen and your own obliviousness was quite convincing,” he said with an applause as he got up on his feet. “You looked like you really tried to believe in what you were saying…even though it only lasted for a moment. “

He looked at me with a slight smirk as he pushed his hands back in his jacket again. “Don’t worry,” he said. Then continued as confusion began to appear on my face, “You don’t have to tell me what you’re thinking. Because like you said before, I’m apart of you. Like a ghost, right? Always speaking to you. Well, you are quite close on that one. However, I would describe myself to be more of an echo in your mind or a shadow to your flesh. But unlike the rest of your soul, I am not littered with lies. I see the raw honesty deep in your core and you know what they say, the truth will always reveal the monster behind the lie.”

I wanted to scream back and tell the voice that it was wrong. But I could feel my throat collapsing from an invisible force. And at the same time, I desperately wanted to shut the voice out of my head and ignore what it was saying. Yet, my limbs remain locked at my sides and the only feeling I could register was the stinging in my palm as I felt something warm drip down my hands. 

“And monsters, they don’t deserve to live in this world.” Then, I heard a click and looked up to see him pull a gun out of his jacket pocket. 

He raised the gun to my face and held it there for a moment before lowering it enough to regain eye contact again. His gaze softened as he spoke again more gently, “I know you think of me as this darkness inside of you that doesn’t belong, but you’re wrong. I just see this constant burden of guilt that you carry around and it hurts me to see you like this. Didn’t it feel better when you told me how you truly felt?”

A yes echoed in my thoughts and I tried to shake the voice away, but it only grew louder and louder. I tried to refute the noise and played tug of war with my thoughts but my rational felt blurry and weak while my emotions felt drunk on a mixture of guilt and sorrow. My high was taking the reins and the puzzle to the verdict of my own crime began to fall in to place. 

My shoulders finally slumped down in exhaustion as I exhaled a shuttered breath. Then I spoke, “It’s been 10 months. I have lived no – survived -through ten suffocating and sleepless months. I’ve tried group counselling, therapy, friends, even alcohol, to try and find a silver lining. To find a version of the story that doesn’t make me to be the bad guy. But most importantly, to forgive myself. But every night I would go to bed and relive this nightmare. I see your face and I’m back to square one.”

“Why do you think that is?” He asked.

I chewed on the inside of my cheek, trying to refrain myself from speaking my mind. But it was useless by now. “It’s selfish. To him. Or… well, I guess you. I feel ashamed sometimes when I see my life becoming better. But I’m tired of this torture. I’m tired of the guilt. The nightmares. The lies I try to tell myself. I wish this would all just end.”

Slowly, he began to lower the gun to his side while staring at the ground beside me. Then, after a dreadful minute he found my eyes and spoke again, “Is that really what you want? You want this to all be over, right? Fine. Prove it then,” he said before throwing the gun to my feet. “You want forgiveness. Real forgiveness. Then atone for his death; An eye for an eye style. Pull the trigger.”

I stared down at the weapon for a lasting moment. Then, I felt something on my face. And I knew it wasn’t the rain making my cheeks wet, so I quickly wiped away the fresh tears trailing down.  Afterwards, I knelt down and picked it up before feeling the heavy weight and smooth steel encasing it. Feeling it in my hands, something designed to kill, ready to kill, I couldn’t help but laugh through my tears. 

It was his turn to look confused. “What’s so funny?” 

I looked up at him before looking down again at the black steel. “I was so ready,” I started as I choked through my words. “To end it all,” I continued while waving the gun in my hand, “But then there is this part of me that just can’t do it. Maybe a sick part of me just wants to keep living inside this nightmare. Or maybe it’s because I know that if I move on, I won’t ever see you again.”

He knelt down in front of me and put his hands over my own, then guided the gun in my hand towards my chest. He looked at me once more, there was no trace of anger or cruelty written on his face, only sadness. Then he pulled me close to him and wrapped his arms around me as I laid my chin on his shoulder. “You’ve been hurting for too long. I can feel that, you know?” He whispered softly. “There must be a million thoughts running through your head at the moment. But right now, I’ve said my part. Because bottom line is, this is your choice.”

My hands were shaking as I felt the cold metal tip twitch against my chest. I took several deep breaths to calm down my shakes before sliding my finger into the trigger. 

But then I began to hear a sound that made my body freeze up. It was the sound of something ringing. It was faint but I tried to focus in on that sound and nothing else. As I began to listen more attentively, it got louder and louder. I could feel my vision become tilted and blurred and the feeling of his body close to me was no longer there. Everything was disappearing, and my eyes were beginning to drift into a different scenery. 

I blinked slowly, trying to re-adjust the blurriness in my eyes. Then looking around, it eventually became clear to me that I was in my bedroom as well as what had just occurred. 

Damn. Another waking nightmare. 

I could still hear the distinct ringing and immediately fixated my eyes at the laptop in front of me. A picture was present on the screen and it took a moment before my mind clicked and realized that my therapist was facetiming me. 

Quickly, I rubbed away the dried tears from my cheeks and instinctively smoothed out my hair before clicking answer. 

“Oh my goodness, I’ve been trying to call you for like ten minutes. We were talking, then suddenly you said you felt dizzy and then you hung up! Are you okay?” She spoke rapidly with a voice filled with alarm and concern.

My mind was still trying to catch up to the present and it took several seconds for me to process her question. But eventually, the gears to my thoughts were working again. “Yeah, don’t worry. Everything’s all good now. I just had a lot of work to do last night and didn’t have the chance to catch up on sleep.” I replied, while struggling to plaster on a convincing smile.

Seeing the slight frown smothering her visage in reaction to my response made it quite clear that she didn’t believe the words coming out of my mouth. But I was glad that she decided to ignore it for once. “Well, try to get some more tonight, alright? Anyways, how about we continue, or would you like to reschedule this for tomorrow so that you can catch up on those missing hours?” She asked with a chuckling smile. 

I returned the same smile as I shook my head, “It’s alright. I’m good to continue. So where did we leave off?”

She nodded in confirmation before speaking again. “Well I just wanted to have an update on how you are feeling right now. More specifically, how you have been dealing with your guilt and perspective on Grayson’s passing. Have the nightmares gotten worse or are you not receiving them as frequently anymore?” 

I ruminated through her words for several long moments while remembering the recent flashbacks from moments ago. But my mind quickly brought the attention to my hands and I looked down at my palms. There were nail indents imbedded on my skin. The flesh had been broken in and dried blood had stained both my skin and fingernails. The sight made my quickening heartbeat thump heavily under my skin. But eventually, I forced myself to focus elsewhere and take a calming deep breath before looking up again at the screen. 

I let out a sunny smile. “It’s um… actually getting much better.” 

Yet despite my cheerful response, those words felt bitter. And my fists could only tighten its grip once again as I allowed the lies to continue piling up one on top of the other.
